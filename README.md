# School Management System

## Objective

The School Management System is a Java project designed to manage employees in a school environment. It provides functionalities to add employees to lists, such as overtime lists and seminar registration lists. The project demonstrates concepts of inheritance, encapsulation, and custom container classes.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing inheritance to create specialized classes
- Using encapsulation to maintain data integrity and code organization
- Creating custom container classes (`MyList` and `MySet`) to manage collections of objects
- Writing test cases to ensure code correctness and functionality
- Designing modular and reusable code structures

### Tools Used

- **Java**: The project is implemented in Java, a widely-used programming language known for its platform independence and versatility.
- **JUnit**: Test cases are written using JUnit, a popular unit testing framework for Java.
- **GitHub**: The code is hosted on GitHub, enabling version control, collaboration, and project showcase.

## Getting Started

To use the School Management System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `SchoolManagerTest` class to execute the test cases and ensure code functionality.
4. Explore the `SchoolManager`, `Employee`, `Container`, `MyList`, and `MySet` classes to understand their roles and functionalities.

## Project Structure

- `SchoolManager.java`: Manages employees in the school and their lists/sets.
- `Employee.java`: Represents an employee in the school management system.
- `Container.java`: A container class that stores objects in an array-like structure.
- `MyList.java`: Simulates an ArrayList concept for adding an unlimited number of elements to the list.
- `MySet.java`: Simulates a custom set that stores unique elements.
- `SchoolManagerTest.java`: Contains test cases to verify the functionality of the project.
